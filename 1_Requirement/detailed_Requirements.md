| Req\_01 | Addition and subtraction | It produces the output as the sum of the two numbers irrespective of sign of the numbers. | Pavani |
| Req\_02 | Multiplication and division | Multiplication is[repeated addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_and_repeated_addition),number times a numberDivision is to divide, a number splits into equal form using the second number | Saloni |
| Req\_03 | AND, OR | AND **-** The result of the operation is 1 if both the bits have the value as 1; otherwise, the result is always 0.OR - The result of the operation is 1 if only one of the expressions has the value as 1; otherwise, the result is always 0. | Tulasi |
| Req\_04 | NOT,NOR,NAND | NOT- It produces an inverted version of the input as the outputNOR- It produces a low output if any of the inputs are high.NAND- It produces a high output if any of the inputs are low. | Manushna |
